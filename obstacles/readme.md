Initial Code idea how to do it is from https://github.com/akchan/cycle_navi

[ ] Line order is split and restarts allways with the next line element of the same line.
[ok] Walop (253BE10003) is not existent.
[ ] Write Point. Refactoring with simplified tilepoint
[ ] Simplify the code redundancy for the recursive loop function.
[ok] Reihenfolge longitude latitude oder Lat/Lon? -> Lat/Lon
[ ] Use Lat/Lon as internal value for a position.
[ok] use pygeotile
[ok] Split calculateion from n -> n+1.
[ok] Calculate steps for the ones spanning multiple tiles.
