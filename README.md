# swisstopo-tile-downloader
Simple python script (map/dowloaderTiles.py) to download tiles from the Swiss Federal Office of Topography, to store them on an SD-Card for another project.

Additionaly a second script (obstacles/downloaderObstacles.py) downloads the flight obstacles and generates the point in the dimension of the downloaded tiles.

Please consider to use Linux or other OS which handles many small files better.
